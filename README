This little binary will tell you if you have a Laptop or Desktop.
It reads this value using the system-type in IOKit (IOPlatformExpertDevice).
You can parse this value your self using the ioreg (-l) command but Its not
formatted well, so I decided to make this as its a pretty common request.
For instance I once had a school district that wanted to turn off wireless
on all Desktops as they were having MYNAME(37) bonjour name conflict issues.

There is a little example.command shell script to show you the two ways you
would use this in your scripts. laptops are value 2 (exit 1) and Desktops are
value 1 (exit 0). The exit values allow you to use standard logic built-in to
run the command and use its exit value. Or if you think thats lame you can
parse the text. To each there own but I like exit values

Known Issues:
As I recall this does not cover PowerPC machines, but I have not seen an intel
that does not use this value. Maybe iPad 3 will be 3 ;)

To Do:
I will make a little installer for it as some point and put it in
/usr/local/bin/system-type
Could use some options as well such as controlling behaviour
Maybe XML output, and put some other values?

Replacement for:
#!/bin/bash
declare -x awk="/usr/bin/awk"
declare -x ioreg="/usr/sbin/ioreg"
# Intel and future systems test
declare IOREG="$("$ioreg" -l |
	"$awk" 'BEGIN {FS="[<>]"}
	/.*\"system-type\".=./{
	systype=$2
	if ( systype == 1 )
		{ print "D" ; exit 0 }
	# System type 1 is a Desktop
	else if ( systype == 2 )
		{ print "L" ; exit 0 }
	# System type 2 is a Laptop
	}')"
